# OTracker

## Monetization Ideas

OTracker can be monetized using a Free vs. Pro model. Here are the suggested features for each tier:

### Free Version
- All basic tracking features
- Up to **3 categories**
- **No HealthKit integration** (cannot link to Apple Health)
- **No import** (cannot restore data from a backup)
- **Export is allowed** (users can back up their data, but not restore)
- **No photo measurements** (or limit to 3 photos, if you want some teaser)
- Basic charts/analytics

### Pro Version (One-Time Purchase)
- **Unlimited categories**
- **HealthKit integration** (link to Apple Health, sync, and write data)
- **Unlimited photo measurements**
- **Import** (restore from backup)
- **Advanced charts/analytics** (optional)
- (Optional) Customization: themes, icons, etc.

#### Rationale
- Export is free so users can always back up their data, but import is Pro to encourage upgrades.
- HealthKit integration and unlimited features are reserved for Pro users.
- This model allows users to try the app and back up their data, while providing clear value for upgrading.
